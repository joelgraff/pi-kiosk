Subject: Next Steps for Media Kiosk Application Development

Hi Grok,

Weâ€™ve made great progress on the media kiosk application running on a Raspberry Pi 5 with X11 (PyQt5, 787x492px window, 24" 1920x1080 monitor). The `AuthDialog` (245x184px, PIN 1234, no title bar) displays correctly at startup, the main window (787x492px) is hidden until authentication, the Local Files screen (30pt title, 20pt fonts, 2/3 file listbox, 1/3 TV outputs, yellow #f1c40f text) works, and video playback via `mpv` on `HDMI-A-1`/`HDMI-A-2` is functional after removing the invalid `--no-video-title-show` parameter. Network share sync (~45 seconds for one file) and scheduling are operational, with no `GLib-GObject-CRITICAL` errors or `libpng` warnings. The `kiosk.py` and `playback.py` files have been updated with detailed comments for context (see artifact IDs 3a481dc1-31cd-48d9-8a5f-c8d8d32b0803 and 21ca27fc-8423-4405-9e96-8dd3a6368e4a).

For context, the application uses:
- Files: `kiosk.py`, `playback.py`, `auth_dialog.py`, `utilities.py`, `source_screen.py`, `interface.py`, `schedule_dialog.py`.
- Logs: `/home/admin/gui/logs/kiosk.log`, `/home/admin/gui/logs/mpv.log`, `/home/admin/gui/logs/mpv_err.log`, `/home/admin/gui/logs/debug.log`.
- Directories: `/home/admin/videos` (local videos), `/mnt/share` (network share), `/home/admin/gui/icons` (64x64px and 32x32px icons).
- Dependencies: PyQt5, `schedule`, `mpv`.

Please review the codebase and confirm you understand it's purpose and that there are no apparent missing elements.
